Made with Unity version `2021.3.16f1`.

The inspiration for Fantom Run came from the increasing popularity and potential of NFTs and blockchain technology in the gaming industry. The aim was to create a unique gaming experience by combining traditional 2D platformer gameplay with the ownership and collectibility of NFTs and the use of ERC20 tokens for in-game currency.

Fantom Run is a 2D platformer game that uses NFTs for characters and ERC20 tokens for in-game currency. Players can collect and own unique NFT characters, each with its own set of skills and abilities. The in-game currency can be used to purchase upgrades and other in-game items.

### Fantom Run for Airdrops

The game finds application in token airdrops. Conventional airdrops have numerous downsides such as:

- Spam and security risk
- Technical complexity
- Bland nature of eligibility tasks
- Token volatility

The game can be integrated with airdrop campaigns and used as a gamified token airdrop platform. In this way, sybil resistance is possible to a satisfactory extent. It also offers a better and interactive user experience, which is beneficial for increased participation and outreach.

#### Staking

Fantom Run also provides provision for staking the earned tokens. Some of the benefits offered by staking tokens are:

- Encourages long-term HODLing
- Lowers token volatility
- Reduced risk of market manipulation
- Users earn passive income in the form of rewards
